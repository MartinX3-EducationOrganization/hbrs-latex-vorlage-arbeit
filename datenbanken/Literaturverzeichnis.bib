 of a custom-built wideband RF front-end for enabling dynamic spectrum
 access communications in software-defined radio platforms. The frontend
 is designed for wireless operation within the 50 MHz - 2.5 GHz frequency
 range, and is entirely software-controlled by the platform. Evaluation
 of the proposed design was conducted using the Universal Software
 Radio Peripheral (USRP) software defined radio platform and controlled
 via GNU Radio software. A prototype of the design was successfully
 demonstrated over a wide range of frequencies. Finally, several remaining
 design challenges are identified that would further enhance transmission
 performance.},

    abstract = {A software defined radio (SDR) is a completely configurable radio
 that can be programmed in software to define its functionality. An
 SDR handset can be modified to perform different functions at different
 times through software downloads. Software radios give the ability
 to add or remove software components or allow plug and play of software
 components. This allows the SDR handset to be specifically tailored
 to the applications expected to run on the handset resulting in great
 flexibility. The downloadable software components can be signal processing
 components, protocol components or application components. The SDR
 forum is evolving a download protocol in liaison with the MExE (mobile
 execution environment) activities of the ETSI forum. Software download
 overheads are an important issue in realizing viable software radios.
 Download requests can be initiated by the user terminal, which is
 termed as a PULL operation or the base station (or the download server)
 can initiate the download process which is termed as a PUSH operation.
 We assert that PUSH is an important mode of software download and
 explore a download architecture that involves PUSH},
